        multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but the clade found in
        the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the
        5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC,
        with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar,
        Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.</p>
